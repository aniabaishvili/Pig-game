## The rules
two players roll the dice and each time the score is added to the total score, but the tricky part is,
whenever a player rolls 1, the current score goes down to zero and no points are added to the total,
while the turn goes to the other player! So no one can roll the dice over and over again, for precaution reasons ðŸ˜ƒ
And the one reaching 100 points is the winner. ðŸ¥‡
